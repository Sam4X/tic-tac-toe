# tic-tac-toe
3x3 tic-tac-toe game with:
1) Randomization
2) Fixed beginning for player 1/2

Use this code as a building block of an advanced tic-tac-toe game. I will post more refined version once it's ready!

I am learning python while building useful projects. This is my first Github public commit.

Let me know if you have any feedback about anything. Happy to learn from the experts :)
